I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the internship opportunity at BCG, as advertised. With a strong foundation in Data Science and interest in Backend Development, I am excited about the prospect of contributing my skills and experiences to your team.

As a current student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Fundação Getulio Vargas, I have immersed myself in various frameworks and libraries within the Python ecosystem. From utilizing Jupyter for interactive data analysis to creating visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn, I have honed my ability to extract meaningful insights from data. Furthermore, my proficiency in Numpy and Pandas has enabled me to manipulate and process data effectively, facilitating sound decision-making.

My academic journey has also led me to projects involving Machine Learning, where Scikit-learn played a pivotal role in model evaluation and performance benchmarking. My curiosity extends to Natural Language Processing, supported by my use of the NLTK library for tasks such as text processing and information extraction. Additionally, my experience contributing to the development of a web system using Django underscores my capacity to engage with real-world applications of technology.

What captivates me most about the Boston Consulting Group is its unwavering dedication to innovation and adept problem-solving. I am especially intrigued by the organization's conscientious approach to the impact of AI-related tools on the work environment and how the world can respond adequately. With my academic background and hands-on experience, I am eager to join a team that values continuous learning and collaborative development.

Enclosed is my resume, which provides further details on my educational background and experiences. I am thrilled by the opportunity to contribute my skills to the Boston Consulting Group as an intern. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background aligns with your team's needs in greater detail.

Sincerely,
Breno.
